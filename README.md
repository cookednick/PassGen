# PassGen

A barebones password generator for the macOS terminal.

![Screenshot](/Screenshot.png "Screenshot")

## Purpose

Sometimes you need a unique password. This app will produce one of a given length using random characters. These characters are uppercase, lowercase, numerals, and symbols.

In the future this program could be enhanced by providing options for which character sets you'd like to include. I will happily accept such pull requests.

On the note of pull requests, if you have a suggestion for how to publish this tool so it could be of greater use, please add an issue or DM me. I'd be interested in such suggestions.

## Arguments

You may optionally supply a character length *(UInt)* in your run call.

`PassGen 16`

If you don't, the app will ask you when run.
